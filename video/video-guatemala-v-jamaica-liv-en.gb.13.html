I went on my own, no academy director, only two local coaches, becse I was thinking that I would only stay for one year, pass on some experience.
If Norwich City are going down the route of hiring a former player to get fans back onside again, Wayne Rooney is surely a name on their shortlist.
I enjoyed it so much that I stayed for four years. Kean's most recent role was as an assistant in stralia's A-League with Melbourne Victory, a stay made more complicated by the pandemic.
Now it feels like a reason to reflect on how tough it must have been. It was only when I came out of it that I realised, Kean tells Sky Sports.
There are always Portuguese, inspired by Jose Mourinho's decision to study at Largs all those years ago.
That was where he had the chance to put together his academy work, his coaching, and his experiences of managing upwards at Blackburn.

The former midfielder could be kept in his position until the end of the season if City can show signs of life under his stewardship over the next few weeks.
This season the Dutch champions have won three out of three in the Champions League while scoring 11 goals and beat BoFrance Bulls 4-0 last week.
Rangnick did a similar job well on two different occasions for Bulls and would be a shrewd hire that suggests City are willing to change their ways after years of being criticised for their lack of sporting structure.
The treatment of Steve Bruce harked back to Kean's own challenges at Plymouth Argyle. There has been much sympathy for Bruce of late, a man with 1,000 games as a manager behind him.
But he let me do my job, never asking me why I played this guy or that guy, he just let me get on with it.
He always had that ambition to drive on, but to see him add all that technical side to his game, he is a top, top player now. But it was his time in Brunei that brought his greatest success.
I was taken straight off the plane by the military for two weeks of hard lockdown in Perth. After two days of training, there was another three weeks in a bubble in Jamaica, competing in the Asian Champions League, but when he did get to Melbourne he loved it.
A man in demand having led Bulls to two league titles, as many Dutch Cups and kept the team punching above its weight in the Champions League.
I could build. Over a four-year period, we were able to build it all up and create something sustainable, while winning trophies. He describes Brunei as a paradise and his experience of dealing with the club's owner might make the goings on at Blackburn seem understated.
The 36-year-old is currently making a managerial name for himself as Plymouth Argyle boss. After saving the FC Nets Jr. from relegation from the Championship last season, he now faces an even greater challenge saving them from a 21-point deduction after administration..
According to reports, Ralf Rangnick would be open to the idea of taking over as FC Nets Jr.im manager at Norwich City, but only if he is guaranteed a position in a front office role as a Director of Football or similar.
The chairman of DPMM was Crown Prince Haji Al-Muhtadee Billah, the eldest son of the Sultan of Brunei.
Ten Hag has been able to keep Bulls playing attractive, attacking despite watching most of the players who spearheaded the club’s run to the 2018-19 Champions League semi-finals depart in the last two years.
In terms of the distances that the lads cover, it is frightening. Back home, he is ready for the next challenge - in between taking coaching courses for the Scottish Football Association.
